# queens

N-queen problem for CS4200. This project uses the straight-forward steepest-ascent hill climbing and the MIN-CONFLICTS algorithm to solve the n-queen problem. 

When you runt the code, a menu pops up asking the user which algorithm they wish to test and also an exit option if they wish to exit. Upon choosing an algorithm, it will show the board configuration and the success rate along with the number of trials. If you wish to exit, you can do so by selecting 3 on the keyboard.
